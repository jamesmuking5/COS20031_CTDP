1) Duration between the time of complaint and resolution. (use date opened/date closed)
2) Search for resolution duration (date closed - opened and sort by longest to shortest)

3) Add address property - get property type count (to decide how many property types)

	
4) User authentication (requries psudocode to explain fully) - "SELECT * FROM property_owner WHERE user_email = 'johndoe@example.com' AND user_password = 'password123';"

5) Find all properties (including type description) owned by a user with a specific email address:
SQL
SELECT p.property_id, p.type, pt.pType_Desc
FROM property p
INNER JOIN property_owner po ON p.user_id = po.user_id
INNER JOIN property_type pt ON p.pType_id = pt.pType_id
WHERE po.user_email = 'user@email.com';

6) List all open cases (date_closed is NULL) for properties of a specific type (e.g., 'Apartment') along with the owner's name:
SQL
SELECT c.case_ref_id, p.type, po.user_name
FROM cases c
INNER JOIN property p ON c.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN property_owner po ON p.user_id = po.user_id
WHERE p.type = 'Apartment' AND c.date_closed IS NULL;

7) Find the total number of properties under development (development_status = 1) for each property type:
SQL
SELECT pt.pType_Desc, COUNT(*) AS total_under_development
FROM property p
INNER JOIN property_type pt ON p.pType_id = pt.pType_id
WHERE p.development_status = 1
GROUP BY pt.pType_Desc;

8) List all users who own more than one property (including property count):
SQL
SELECT po.user_id, po.user_name, COUNT(*) AS property_count
FROM property_owner po
INNER JOIN property p ON po.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY po.user_id
HAVING property_count > 1;

9) Find properties with floorplan defects reported in cases, excluding those resolved (date_closed is not NULL):
SQL
SELECT p.property_id, p.type
FROM property p
INNER JOIN cases c ON p.property_id = c.property_id
WHERE c.floorplan_defect IS NOT NULL AND c.date_closed IS NULL;

10) Identify staff members who haven't closed any cases yet (date_closed is NULL for all their cases):
SQL
SELECT staff_id
FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN cases c ON s.staff_id = c.staff_id
GROUP BY staff_id
HAVING COUNT(c.case_ref_id) > 0 AND SUM(CASE WHEN c.date_closed IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = COUNT(c.case_ref_id);

11) Find the user with the most open cases (date_closed is NULL):
SQL
SELECT po.user_name, COUNT(*) AS open_cases
FROM property_owner po
INNER JOIN cases c ON po.user_id = c.user_id
WHERE c.date_closed IS NULL
GROUP BY po.user_id
ORDER BY open_cases DESC
LIMIT 1;

12) Find the average number of properties owned per user:
SQL
SELECT AVG(property_count) AS avg_properties_per_user
FROM (
  SELECT po.user_id, COUNT(*) AS property_count
  FROM property_owner po
  INNER JOIN property p ON po.user_id = p.user_id
  GROUP BY po.user_id
) AS user_properties;

13) List all properties of a specific owner (using user_id) with their development status:
SQL
SELECT p.property_id, p.type, 
  CASE WHEN p.development_status = 0 THEN 'Not Under Development'
       WHEN p.development_status = 1 THEN 'Under Development'
  END AS development_status
FROM property p
WHERE p.user_id = 1001;
