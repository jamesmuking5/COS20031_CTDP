# **Explanation:**

## USE_CASE_1:

This SQL script creates a stored procedure named `GetCaseDuration` that calculates the duration of the latest case for a given user and property, if available and the case is closed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `CREATE PROCEDURE GetCaseDuration() BEGIN ... END`: This creates a stored procedure named `GetCaseDuration`.

2. `DECLARE user_exists INT;`: This declares a variable named `user_exists` that will be used to check if the user exists in the `property_owner` table.

3. `SELECT COUNT(*) INTO user_exists FROM property_owner WHERE user_id = 299;`: This checks if a user with `user_id` 299 exists in the `property_owner` table. If the user exists, `user_exists` will be greater than 0.

4. `IF user_exists > 0 THEN ... ELSE ... END IF;`: This is a conditional statement that checks the value of `user_exists`. If `user_exists` is greater than 0, it means the user exists and the code inside the `THEN` block is executed. If `user_exists` is not greater than 0, it means the user does not exist and the code inside the `ELSE` block is executed.

5. Inside the `THEN` block, a `SELECT` statement is used to calculate the duration of the latest case for the user from the `cases` table. The `CASE` statement checks if `date_closed` is not null. If it's not null, it calculates the duration between `date_opened` and `date_closed` in months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. If `date_closed` is null, it returns 'No closed date available'.

6. Inside the `ELSE` block, a `SELECT` statement is used to return a message saying 'User does not exist'.

7. `CALL GetCaseDuration();`: This calls the `GetCaseDuration` procedure.

8. `DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS GetCaseDuration;`: This deletes the `GetCaseDuration` procedure after it has been called. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent an error from occurring if the procedure does not exist.
